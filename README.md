# Lab Access System

This project is part of our Capstone Design Project for Sungkyunkwan University.

## Overview
The **Lab Access System** is a Raspberry Pi-based solution for secure lab entry. It uses facial recognition and QR codes to validate student reservations, ensuring secure and seamless access during their reserved times.

Initially developed as a web application, the project faced some limitations that impacted overall performance and features like QR code scanning. To address these challenges and ensure seamless integration of features, the project was transitioned to a Python-based application.

- **Frontend**:
  - Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, and **AJAX**.
  - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Backend**:
  - Powered by **PHP** and deployed on **AWS Lightsail**.
  - Uses APIs for managing reservations, facial recognition, and notifications.
- **Database**:
  - Managed with **MySQL** and hosted on **AWS RDS**.
- **AI and Hardware Integration**:
  - Facial recognition using **DeepFace Library** with the **ArcFace Model**.
  - **Raspberry Pi 5** and **Camera 3** for processing and access control.
- **Deployment**:
  - Images stored on **AWS S3** and served through pre-signed URLs.
  - SMTP service via **Google** for email notifications.

## Lab Access System Features
### Core Features
- **Facial Recognition Access**:
  - Uses AI-powered facial recognition via the DeepFace library (ArcFace model).
  - Matches the studentâ€™s face against their reservation photo for authentication.
- **QR Code Access**:
  - An alternative method for students to unlock the lab using a generated QR code.
- **Reservation Validation**:
  - Verifies reservations in real-time by communicating with the Lab Reservation System's database.
  
### Admin Features
- **Lab Setting**: Allows setting the device to any of the existing labs.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Facial Recognition Lag**: Addressed by deploying the AI model locally on the Raspberry Pi.
- **Thread Freezing**: Resolved by handling requests asynchronously using the `aiohttp` library.
- **Library Compatibility**: Managed by setting up a virtual environment and finding substitute libraries when needed.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a real unlocking mechanism to control physical lab doors.
- Optimize response time for facial recognition by moving computations to the cloud.
- Add support for NFC or other alternative access methods.
